    build_notes: |
      Operator failed to solder a resistor array on the right side of the pcb
      and had to unsolder a the component, breaking it and damaging the pcb.
      After buying a new resistor array and trying soldering it properly,
      another mistake was made. The module ended up partially working. There is
      a remaining issue with the output voltage levels, making it unusable.
      Output levels are not sufficient for a standard trigger/gate signal and
      most envelope generators or samplers react poorly to it
