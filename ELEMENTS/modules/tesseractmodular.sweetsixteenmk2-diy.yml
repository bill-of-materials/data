    failure_notes: |
      After spending too much time trying to fix the module and resolder all
      solder points, operator failed to properly plug the power socket on the
      right pins, resulting in a short on the Teensy. Teensy 3.1 being
      impossible to order in 2024, operator chose to buy a new factory version
      of the module instead.
