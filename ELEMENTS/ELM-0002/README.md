# ELM-0002: "The Black Case"

## History

### 2015-10-27

A black box with unknown content is

on Arksine's social network page. The box seems to have been made for an
operator called NEMOCAINE. Further research seems to indicate that the operator
is also known as MODGEIST.

### 2015-11-11

Mysterious meeting in a french airport. A picture found on social networks seem
to indicate this could be a transaction between Modgeist and Arksine.

### 2016-?

Ulterior research confirm that Modgeist is in possession of the black box and
extensively using it. It's purpose is to store and power electronic components
producing sound transmissions and lights. People seem to react positively to
those transmissions, and the box was moved to multiple gigs, including outside
of France.

### 2016-12-14

A year later, B.O.M. surveillance networks log an online chat between
Modgeist and SCHEMATiC WiZARD, the subject seems to be the acquisition of an
empty [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) case.

Full archives are missing, but B.O.M. reports indicate that Modgeist had ask
Arksine to build another black case, a bigger one, and the former had to be
sold. A meeting between Modgeist and SW is planned for the next month.

### 2017-01-07

Buying transaction between Modgeist and SW. SW reports this transaction to be
his "first introduction to the modular world". A picture was posted on social
networks a few hours later.

### 2017-02-14

A month later, a first Eurorack module is plugged to the black Eurorack case:
A [Pingable Enveloppe Generator](https://4mscompany.com/peg.php) (4ms)


### 2017-02-19

5 days later, a second module is plugged into the case, a wavetable sound source
[Braids](https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/modules/braids/)
(Mutable Instruments), bought from operator
[Holmia](https://soundcloud.com/holmia)). Used in combination with a MS-20 mini
to fill the gaps (missing VCA and VCF), the experience is described as "life
changing" by SW, as he witnesses the 0-12V current flow triggering modules and
propagating audio transmissions accross the hardware. The sound was described as
"raw, intense, beefy", with textures that SW has never heard live before.

A testing sandbox was dropped as a livestream on Youtube, where the
transmission can still be watched and listened to if you own the link.

`[EDIT]`: The link has been found in the B.O.M. archives, [sw_teststream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aDBSkdGnxE)

See `[REDACTED]` for more information.


## Specifications

The Black Case is a transportable Eurorack modular synth case with a decent
amount of Eurorack modules plugged in. The module selection has evolved over the
years.

### Case details

*Width:* 84HP

*Height:* 4x 3U (6U + 6U)

*PSU:* 2x Cincon-TTA, 100-240V, 2x 4.6A, with 2x IEC C13 <> FR cables

*Power Bus:* 2x [2HP Zeus
Access](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/tiptop-audio-zeus-access) + 2x [Zeus
Studio Bus DC800](https://tiptopaudio.com/zeus-studio-bus/)

The case is made of wood, with classic flight case ruguous coating, a bit heavy
but resistant. Each 6U part can be used independently. More details about the
case can be found on [Arksine's website](https://arksine.tumblr.com/).

*Usage:* Multipurpose case, in SW's hand it has evolved to host a classic
VCO/FILTER/VCA voicing + sequencing system.
