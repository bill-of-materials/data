      A 20 pin header sold on the wrong side of the PCB. Operator had to reorder
      one at Saint Quentin Radio. Some leds don't like and buttons don't work.

    build_notes: |
      After finally finding an email to contact Robaux, operator received the
      module schematics allowing it to reverse engineer the PCB and fix
      two broken PCB parts with hard wire. Module is fragile and PCB esthetics
      messy, but functionnal. Documented on Instagram, @schematicwizard SMD Hell
      pinned stories.
